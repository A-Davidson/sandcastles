##Sandcastles Web-App for ACM Jamathon

A Timed Online Recorded Collaborative Hub (TORCH)

##What is Sandcastles?

Sandcastles is a webapp that allows users to work in a Timed Online Recorded Collaborative Hub (TORCH). These torches are workspaces with varying levels of user management, intuitive creativity tools, and group organization tools. Members of a workspace have a limited amount of time to collaborate in a variety of electronic media environments. When time runs out, the project is frozen as-is and indexed for publishing. Limiting time enforces a rapid work environment, encourages cooperation, and creates emphasis on minimum production rather than painstaking detail.
